|===
|Field |Description
|File upload |For OAS, choose an OAS file with the .yaml or .json file types.
For RAML, choose a RAML file with the .raml file type. Zip files are also accepted with the 
file to upload residing in the zip file's root directory.
|Main file |Specify the main file if the uploaded file is a fragment. Otherwise, Exchange 
uses the same file name as the file you upload.
|Version |The new version number. The Version and API version values need to agree 
in that you can only choose minor version updates for a given API version. To set a major
Version number, also increase the API version.
|===

You can also change the version number for RAMLs as described in the next sections.

== Change a RAML Version from the Specification

Change the `version:` element in your RAML specification.
You can use a text editor or API Designer in the Design Center feature of Anypoint Platform.
When you update the version element in the RAML specification and publish to Exchange, the publish menu automatically picks up the change from the `version:` element.

== Change a RAML Version When you Publish to Exchange

. From Design Center, open your API. No changes are necessary.
