You can upload up to 100 resources to a public portal. Each image is one resource. Attempting to add more will result in an error. You can delete resources to reduce the number and then add more up to the limit.

These examples show how to list, retrieve, and delete resources from a public portal with the Exchange Experience API.

== Authentication

Login to the Anypoint Platform and get an authentication token. Make every request with the header `Authorization: bearer ACCESS_TOKEN`.

[source,console]
----
ACCESS_TOKEN=$(curl https://anypoint.mulesoft.com/accounts/login \
-XPOST -d "username=YOUR_USERNAME&password=YOUR_PASSWORD" | \
jq -r ".access_token")
----
