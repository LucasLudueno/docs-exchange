In Anypoint Exchange private and Exchange portal, to share an API, example, template, or connector means that
you first create an asset corresponding to the asset type.

How you create an asset depends on its type.

* For OAS 2.0, RAML, RAML fragments, HTTP, WSDL, and Custom assets, create the asset directly using the Exchange *New asset* menu.
* For an example or template, create each using the Mavenize feature in Anypoint Studio, and publish each to Exchange.
* For a connector, policy, example, or template, see xref:to-publish-assets-maven.adoc[Publish and Deploy Exchange Assets Using Maven].
* You can also publish a RAML, and OAS and RAML fragments using Design Center and publishing the API to Exchange.
+
Another way to publish these type of assets is using the https://anypoint.mulesoft.com/exchange/portals/anypoint-platform/f1e97bc6-315a-4490-82a7-23abe036327a.anypoint-platform/exchange-experience-api/[Exchange Experience API].
* RAML and OAS API specifications can be uploaded to Exchange with the xref:runtime-manager::anypoint-platform-cli.adoc[Anypoint Platform Command Line Interface (CLI)].
+
For example: `exchange asset upload --classifier raml --apiVersion v1 --name HelloWorld --mainFile helloworld.raml helloword/1.0.0 /Users/nmouso/Downloads/helloworld.raml.zip`

Each asset in Exchange is versioned. You can manage which versions are visible by deprecating a version to hide it, and you can delete versions if needed.

Note: In addition to asset versions, APIs have a consumer facing API version that is shown at the top of an asset's detail screen. This API version is defined by API providers.

This illustration summarizes how each asset type (in green) appears in Exchange:

== Create an API Asset

An API asset specifies an interface, including its functions, descriptions, how to handle return codes, and dependencies.

To create an API asset:

. In Exchange, select *New asset*.
. Enter the asset name.
. Select the asset type from the drop-down list:
+
* REST API - RAML: Provide a RAML API specification file. RAML specifications must be a RAML file (.raml).
* REST API - OAS: Provide an OAS/Swagger 2.0 API specification file. (Exchange does not support OAS 3.0.) OAS specifications can be either a YAML (.yaml) or JSON (.json) file.
* SOAP API - WSDL: Provide a WSDL API specification file. SOAP specifications file can be either a WSDL (.wsdl) or XML (.xml) file.
* API Spec Fragment - RAML : Provide an API Fragment RAML specification file. Fragment specifications must be a RAML file (.raml).
* HTTP API - This asset does not require a file, this type of asset provides an API endpoint 
that is defined by API Manager. 
+
. For RAML, API Spec Fragment, OAS, and WSDL assets:
+
.. Select *Choose File* to locate the API specification file.
.. Select the Main file of the API. If the file is a zip, the Main file should be in the root directory inside the zip. If the file is not a zip or if it has only one Main file, it's selected automatically.
+
. (Optional) Select *Advanced* and edit the advanced settings: *GroupId*, *AssetId*, *Version*, and *API version*. Exchange generates the group ID, asset ID, and version for you, and you can change these values here. You can change an API asset's version (asset version) and API version separately. The advanced settings are most often used to change the asset version.
. Select *Publish*.


== Create a Custom Asset

A custom asset lets you share information about any aspect of your organization such as announcements, documentation, videos, and sharing files. You can add an optional file to your Custom asset that users can download. The file is stored in Exchange.

*Note:* Exchange only permits the following file types as the optional file in a Custom asset:

Images: `.jpg, .jpeg, .png, .gif, .svg` +
Documents: `.doc, .docx, .pdf, .ppt, .pptx, .rtf, .vsd, .vsdx, .vss, .vsdx` +
Compressed files: `.zip, .tgz, .jar, .gz, .7z` +
Text files: `.txt, .json, .raml, .yaml, .yml, .md, .csv, .xml, .xsd, .wsdl, .html, .pom, .log, .sql`

A file without a file type is not allowed. All file types are case insensitive.

MuleSoft recommends deleting all old Custom assets containing files of types that are no longer permitted. For any Custom asset containing a non-supported file, delete the asset to remove the file.

To create a custom asset:

. In Exchange, select *New asset*.
. Enter the asset name.
. Select the asset type *Custom* from the drop-down list.
. (Optional) To share a file with users, choose the file.
. (Optional) Select *Advanced* and edit the advanced settings: *GroupId*, *AssetId*, and *Version*. Exchange generates the group ID, asset ID, and version for you, and you can change these values here. The advanced settings are most often used to change the asset version.
. Select *Publish*.


== Create a New Version of an Existing Asset

If you have contributor or admin access to an asset, you can add a new version from the asset portal:

. In Exchange, open the asset list and select the asset.
. In the sidebar *Versions* table, select *Add New Version*.
. Enter the *Version* (asset version).
. (Optional) Enter the *API version*.
. (Optional) Choose a file to upload.
. Select *Publish*.

The new version of the asset has the same name, icon, and description as the previous version. Any changes to these properties apply to all versions of the asset.
