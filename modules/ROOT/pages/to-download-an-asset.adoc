Download lets you download a copy of the asset, or in the case of a Custom asset, the optional file attached to the asset when it was created.

After creating a REST asset, Exchange generates a Mule 3 connector and a Mule 4 connector. Exchange also generates an OAS version for RAML assets, and a RAML version for OAS assets. After you create a new REST asset it may take a few minutes for these assets to appear on the Download menu.
