Search uses query language to search assets by tags, categories, custom fields, and lifecycle states. 

== Search by Type

Exchange supports the following asset types:

* API Groups
* API Spec Fragments
* Connectors
* Custom
* Examples
* HTTP APIs
* Policies
* REST APIs
* SOAP APIs
* Templates

To search for assets by type:

. Click *Any type*.
. Select from the list. You can select more than one type.
. Click *Apply*. The corresponding assets display in the search results.

=== Search API Specifications

The following API specification properties are used in search:

* API title
* Base URI
* Endpoints
** Path
** Display name
** Description
* Methods
** Method type (GET, POST, PUT)
** Description
* Query parameters
** Name
** Description
* URI parameters
** Name
* Types
** Name
** Properties
* Traits
* Properties
* Security schemas

These property names are based on RAML specifications. Equivalent properties are indexed for OAS specifications. For example, RAML uses base URI but OAS uses host and path.

This example shows an API specification:

== Search by Organizations

You can select which organizations to include in each search. By default, no organization is selected in the menu, and Exchange searches MuleSoft public assets and the assets of the root organization and its business groups.

. Click *Any organization*. 
. Enter a name of a category or select one or more options from the list.
. Click *Apply*.

== Search by Categories

You can search for assets by predefined categories. You can search for a combination of categories, and you can search for multiple values for the same category. Multiple values for the same category are combined with the OR operator.

. Click *Any category*. 
. Enter a name of a category or select one or more options from the list.
. Click *Apply*.

== Search by Tags

Search by tags that were created by an Exchange administrator or organization owner.

. Click *Any tag*.
. Enter a name of a tag or select one or more options from the list.
. Click *Apply*.


== Search by Lifecycle States

In the software development lifecycle, assets are developed, released, and eventually deprecated. Each Exchange asset version moves through the lifecycle states of `development`, `stable`, and `deprecated`.

Find asset versions that are ready for consumption, in development, or have been deprecated.

. From the details asset pane, click *Any Lifecycle state*.
. Select an option from the list and click *Apply*.
. Assets in that state display in the search results.
. (Optional) Click *Save this search* to create a shortcut for this search. Saved searches display in the left navigation bar.


== Save a Search

To quickly find assets, save shortcuts to filters that you have applied. Saved searches are arranged in alphabetical order in the left navigation bar.

. Enter a search term in the *Search all assets* field and click *Save this search*.
. Enter the name for the search.
. Select an option to save as *My search* or an organization search.
. Click *Save search*.

=== Rename or Delete a Saved Search

Saved searches can be renamed or deleted.

To rename a saved search:

== Sort Search Results 

To select the ranking of search results, use the *Sort by* drop-down menu to choose *Relevance* (default), *Name*, *Last modified*, or *Rating*. 

Relevance sorts the matching results by where a match is found in the asset metadata, such as name, title, pages, and API specification metadata. API specification metadata includes endpoints and types.
