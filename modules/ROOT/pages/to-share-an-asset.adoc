Exchange administrators and asset administrators can share an asset with another user in their organization or with an external organization.

== Share With a User

If the person is not in your organization,
click Access Management > Users to add them.

. Click an asset to show its details and click Share.
. In the Share menu, type a few letters of the person's name you want to share this asset with.
Or click a filter to list only users who have Viewer, Contributor, or Admin rights.
. Click Add.
. Repeat steps 2 and 3 to add additional users to share the asset with.

You can also use the Share menu to change who you are sharing the asset with or to stop sharing with one or more users.

== Share With an External Organization

Exchange administrators and asset administrators can grant viewer access for an asset to everyone in a chosen external organization.

The organization granting viewer access is the granting organization, and the organization that receives access is the receiving organization.

. The receiving organization adds the granting organization to its "External Access" list in Anypoint Access Management, as described in xref:access-management::external-org-access.adoc[External Organization Access].
+
Assets can only be shared with another organization if that organization has enabled receiving viewer access to assets from external organizations.
+
. Login to your Exchange administrator or asset administrator account in the granting organization.
. Click an asset to show its details and click Share.
. In the Share menu, begin typing the name of the external organization you want to share the asset with.
. Select the organization you want to grant viewer access to.
. Repeat steps 4 and 5 to add additional organizations to share the asset with.

When an asset is shared with an organization, email notification is sent to the maintainer of the organization's default "All Users" team. Usually this is the organization administrator.

You can also use the Share menu to change who you are sharing the asset with or to stop sharing with one or more organizations.

Any Exchange user can click the *Shared with me* link in the left navigation menu of Exchange to show all assets shared with their user account and all assets shared with their organization.

Only internal users can request access to an API or gain the contributor or administrator roles.
