== How to edit the a portal page

=== Add an Image

You can copy and paste an image directly into the Exchange page:

. Click Edit
. Click Visual mode
. If your image is on your computer, drag the image to the Exchange page, or copy and paste to the Exchange page.
+
If the image is on a web server, copy the image and paste it into the Exchange page.

Alternatively you can click the image icon in the editor and provide a URL to an illustration available on the web.

In Markdown, use this syntax to reference a web served image:

`+![some alt text](http://www.example.com/image/png.png)+`

Images uploaded before May 2019 can be accessed without authentication, and images uploaded after May 2019 require authentication. To disable unauthenticated access to an image uploaded before May 2019, download it, delete it, and upload it again.


=== Add Secondary Pages

. Click Edit.
. In the left navigation area, click Add New Page and press the Return key on your keyboard to create the page. You can create as many pages as needed. In Exchange Portals, click Add Content Pages.
. Add a description to the page. Anything you can add on the main page can be added to the subordinate page.
. After creating a page, click Save As Draft so you don't lose content if Exchange times out.
. When done creating pages, click Publish.

In Edit mode, you can reorder pages by clicking the page name and dragging the page up or down in the left nav bar.

All page names are validated:

* Page name length must be from 1 to 128 characters.
* A page name cannot be the reserved name `home`.
* Page names cannot be the name of an existing page.
* Page names cannot contain these characters: `@` `*` `+` `/` `_` `\`
* Page names cannot start with `.`


=== Specify Terms and Conditions

. Click an asset and click Edit.
. Click Add Terms and Conditions: image:ex2-terms.png[Terms and Conditions button]
. Use the editor to specify the terms and conditions for this asset.
. Click Save As Draft.
. Publish.

Note: Only available for APIs. Users are then prompted to accept the terms and conditions when requesting API access.


=== Editor Notes

* To use the link control, type text, select the text, and click the link control to specify the link URL.
* If your Exchange session times out while you're editing, select all the text on the page and copy it to your
clipboard. Then after you log back in, you can paste the content back into the page and save your draft. When a timeout occurs, unsaved content is purged.
* You can access international characters by pressing and holding a character.
* If you are editing descriptions for many assets, instead of clicking an asset to open it from Exchange, instead right-click the asset and click Open Link in New Window to open the asset in a new browser window. Otherwise, after you publish an asset, control returns to the start of the filter/search list.
* Keyboard shortcuts (work in Visual and Markdown): Bold: ctrl-b/cmd-b, Italics: ctrl-i/cmd-i, Heading: ctrl-d/cmd-d, Blockquote: ctrl-e/cmd-e, Code Block: ctrl-j/cmd-j, Numbered List: ctrl-o/cmd-o, Bullet List: ctrl-u/cmd-u, Insert Link: ctrl-k/cmd-k.
