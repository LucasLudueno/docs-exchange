When you click an asset, Anypoint Exchange provides detailed information:

* Left navigation area - Lists additional pages, saved search terms, application names, and instances. For a REST API,
this area lists the HTTP functions in the REST specification. For a policy, this area lists *Terms and conditions* and *APIs using this policy*.
* Right detail panel - Lists the asset type, when the asset was created and by which organization, when the asset was last published, a list of asset patch versions, and the tags and categories of the asset. For REST APIs, the right panel lets you test the API by creating example calls, test data (mocking), and the ability to send data to the API and view the results.

In the table of asset patch versions on the detail panel, each version has a drop-down menu with a *Version detail* option that shows information about that version, including who created it, when it was published, and any dependent assets.

== View Assets by Business Group

A business group provides a way to group individuals within an organization. A system administrator assigns users to belong to a business group. Each business group can have separate Exchange assets. You need to log into
Anypoint Platform to view the business groups. Click a group name from the taskbar.

If you cannot see additional groups, contact your Exchange administrator. 

If you cannot find an asset in one group, it may be in another business group. To find assets from other business groups, in the left navigation bar, click *All assets*. The left navigation area provides additional areas to search. The "Provided by MuleSoft" scope lists assets provided by MuleSoft. The "All assets" scope lists assets provided by MuleSoft and your own master organization. Business group scopes list assets built by users within a business group.

== View REST API Elements in an Asset

. In the left navigation area you can view RAML or OAS API specification information such as resources and the methods in each resource. Click a method button to view information about the API:
+

+
. Use the right side of a method view to experiment with the API. This functionality is similar to what you can expect in programs such as Postman where you can specify custom HTTP headers and test each API's method using the API's endpoint.
. Click Request Access to tie the API you're viewing to one of your applications so that you can use the API to send and receive data that your application can consume.

== Test an API with API Notebook

. Click API Notebook in the content page if one is available for the API.
. After you read the description for usage information, you can experiment with the example in the code block to try different parameters and values, and see the results in real time.
. Click Play to test the method in the code example and view the results.
