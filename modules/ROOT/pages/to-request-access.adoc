To implement an API, the client application must first request access. When the
request is approved by the API, a contract is created between the client
application and the API, and the client application is registered.

APIs that are protected by a client ID enforcement policy require client
applications to provide a client ID and client secret. The client ID and client
secret credentials are automatically created when the client application is
registered. These credentials enable the application to access the API and
provide consumer analytics for an API developer.

API contracts are visible to API consumers in Exchange, and visible to API
providers in API Manager.

API providers can view, manage, and revoke these contracts with the steps in
xref:api-manager::manage-client-apps-latest-task.adoc[Managing API Instance Contracts on API Manager].

If terms and conditions are set for an asset, you are prompted to accept the terms before access is granted.
