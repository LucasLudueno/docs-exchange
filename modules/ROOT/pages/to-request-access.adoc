Requesting access registers a client and creates an API contract between an API
and the client application.

APIs that are protected by a client ID enforcement policy require
applications to have a client ID and client secret. This enables the
application to access the API and provides consumer analytics for an API
developer.

API contracts are visible to API consumers in Exchange, and visible to API
providers in API Manager.

API providers can view, manage, and revoke these contracts with the steps in
xref:api-manager::manage-client-apps-latest-task.adoc[Managing API Instance Contracts on API Manager].

If terms and conditions are set for an asset, you are prompted to accept the terms before access is granted.
