Anypoint Exchange is a curated catalog of reusable assets such as APIs, policies, API spec fragments, API groups, templates, examples, custom assets, and integration assets such as connectors. You can catalog (publish), share, discover, learn about, and reuse assets within your organization that drive collaboration, boost productivity, and promote standards.

Use Exchange to discover, share, and incorporate assets and resources into your applications. Exchange helps you create API developer portals, view and test APIs, simulate sending data to APIs by using the mocking service, create assets, and use API Notebooks to describe and test API functions.

Exchange assets are accessible in Anypoint Studio (connectors, templates, and examples), API Manager (APIs, API groups, and policies), and Runtime Manager (APIs), and you can publish APIs from Design Center to Exchange.

Using multiple languages with Unicode is supported fully throughout Exchange and in all metadata fields, including asset names, descriptions, markdown pages, categories, tags, and reviews.

MuleSoft certifies its public assets and reviews and approves partner connectors. All private assets are internal to an organization and not visible outside that organization. Customers are responsible for any private assets they publish within their Exchange instance.
