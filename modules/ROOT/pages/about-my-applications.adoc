The My Applications area in the Exchange details view for an asset lists
applications that hold a contract between an API and a user.

image::ex2-my-applications.png[]

A contract holds information about the contract with a client ID and client secret for the API.
Each application lists a description, its URL, redirect URIs, grant types, and a usage dashboard.

The usage information enables you to set the verification duration. If not specified,
the range is the previous eight days. The usage lists the total number of requests to
the API, average latency, the error rate, and graphs for total requests,
requests by HTTP status code, and the error percentage.

Applications in My Applications are registered using API Manager in Anypoint Platform.

When you request access, the client application is registered and creates an
API contract between the API and the client.

If you don't have an application to link to your API, you can create the application
in the Request Access menu. You can then click Request Access to connect your
application and the API.

APIs that are protected by a client ID enforcement policy require
applications to have a client ID and client secret. This enables the
application to access the API and provides consumer analytics for an API
developer.

API contracts are visible to API consumers in Exchange, and visible to API
providers in API Manager.
