The My Applications area in the Exchange details view for an asset lists
applications that hold a contract between an API and a user.

Each client application has a client ID, client secret, description, URL, redirect URIs,
grant types, and a usage dashboard.

The usage information enables you to set the verification duration. If not specified,
the range is the previous eight days. The usage lists total number of requests to
the API, average latency, error rate, and graphs for total requests,
requests by HTTP status code, and error percentage.

Applications in My Applications are registered using API Manager in Anypoint Platform.

To register a client application to an existing API, the client application
must first request access. When the request is approved by the API owner, a
contract is created between the client application and the API, and the client
application is registered.

If you don't have an application to link to your API, you can create the application
in the Request Access menu. You can then click Request Access to connect your
application and the API. Some APIs require selecting a service-level agreement
(SLA), accepting terms and conditions, or both.

APIs that are protected by a client ID enforcement policy require client
applications to provide a client ID and optional client secret. The client ID and client
secret credentials are automatically created when the client application is
registered.

An API owner can use API Manager to view all API contracts ever created for an
API instance. An API consumer can use Exchange's *My Applications* page to view
the API contracts created between an API instance and that consumer's client
applications.
