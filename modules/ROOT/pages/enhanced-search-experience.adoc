The enhanced search experience, also known as the new search, is available in the US cloud and the EU cloud. This search experience includes more options for search ranking, an enhanced interface, and more options for searching by types, tags, categories, organizations, and lifecycle states.

Search options are located on the landing page of the Exchange catalog.

The Exchange catalog of assets can display hundreds of assets. You can refine the list of assets that display using search terms like a name of an API or use the type filter option to get a list of all REST APIs.


== Filter

Use filters to refine your search results. You can filter using the following options:

 * Type
 * Organization
 * Catergory
 * Tag
 * Lifecycle state

To filter search results use the search drop-down menus on the landing page.

== Sort

Search results can be sorted by the following options:

* Relevance
* Name
* Last modified
* Rating

To sort the ranking of search results, use the Sort by drop-down menu to choose Relevance (default), Name, Last modified, or Rating. Relevance sorts the matching results by where a match is found in the asset metadata, such as name, title, pages, and API specification metadata. API specification metadata includes endpoints and types.

== Search Organizations

You can select which of the organizations are visible to you to include in each search.
