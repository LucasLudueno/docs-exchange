You can use a private Exchange or an Exchange public portal to share Mule XML example code, templates, connectors, policies, APIs, API Groups, and custom information assets. Sharing assets provides a repository for code and APIs, and helps your organization access them easily, model them, and reuse them.

A private Exchange makes it easy to share assets with internal developers by giving them viewer, contributor, or administrator access. Additionally, assets created within a business group are automatically shared with developers within that business group.

An Exchange public portal enables Exchange administrators to share assets externally with developers outside of their own organization.

Both Exchange views also let users review assets so that asset providers can get feedback.

See the xref:exchange2-faq.adoc[FAQ] for additional information.
