Publish APIs, API Groups, templates, connectors, policies, Mule XML example code, and custom information assets to a private Exchange or an Exchange public portal. Exchange provides a repository for code and APIs, and helps your organization access them easily, model them, and reuse them.

A private Exchange makes it easy to provide assets to internal developers by giving them viewer, contributor, or administrator access. Additionally, assets created within a business group are automatically provided to the developers of that business group.

An Exchange public portal enables Exchange administrators to provide assets externally to developers outside of their own organization.

Both Exchange views also let users review assets so that asset providers can get feedback.

See the xref:exchange2-faq.adoc[FAQ] for additional information.
