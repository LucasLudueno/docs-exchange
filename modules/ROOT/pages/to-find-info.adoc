Exchange helps you find assets. You can search for assets, click All Types to filter for specific assets, or combine search
text with an All Types filter.

<<index.adoc#content-types,Content Types>> lists the different types of asset.

== Asset Details

When you click an asset, Exchange provides detailed information:

* Left navigation area - Lists additional pages, saved search terms, application names, instances, and for a REST API,
the HTTP functions in the REST specification.
* Right detail panel - Lists the asset type, when the asset was created and by which organization, when the asset was last published, the version, and the asset's dependencies. For REST APIs, the right panel lets you test the API by creating example calls, test data (mocking), and the ability to send data to the API and view the results.

== Exchange Search

Exchange Search looks for terms in:

* Each asset's name
* Tags
* Categories
* Custom attributes (also known as custom fields)
* The content of the asset portal pages
* xref:to-find-info.adoc#searching-api-specifications[Properties defined in RAML and OAS API specifications]

You can combine search terms with the filters listed in All Types.

You can also search by clicking Category or Tag elements. This creates a filtered search you can use to find similar assets.

Searches only apply to the Exchange organization you are viewing. If you search in a private Exchange organization, the search only lists that organization's assets and not MuleSoft's public assets.

== Save a Search

. Enter a search term and click Save This Search.
. Exchange prompts you to give the search a name, and to select if the search is for your organization or personal. Administrators can save searches visible to anyone in their current business group. Personal searches are visible only to the person who creates them.
. View the left navigation bar to see the saved searches. Exchange lists search terms specific to your business group. Below those terms are saved searches you created.

== View Assets by Business Group

A business group provides a way to group individuals within an organization. A system administrator assigns users to belong to a business group. Each business group can have separate Exchange assets. You need to log into
Anypoint Platform to view the business groups. Click a group name from the taskbar.

If you cannot see additional groups, contact your Exchange administrator. 

If you cannot find an asset in one group, it may be in another business group. To find assets from other business groups click *All assets*. The left navigation area provides additional areas to search. The "Provided by MuleSoft" scope lists assets provided by MuleSoft. The "All assets" scope lists assets provided by MuleSoft and your own master organization. Business group scopes list assets built by users within a business group.

== View REST API Elements in an Asset

. In the left navigation area you can view RAML or OAS API specification information such as resources and the methods in each resource. Click a method button to view information about the API:
+
image::ex2-rest-ftns.png[Screenshot - REST API function buttons in left nav bar]
+
. Use the right side of a method view to experiment with the API. This functionality is similar to what you can expect in programs such as Postman where you can specify custom HTTP headers and test each API's method using the API's endpoint.
. Click Request Access to tie the API you're viewing to one of your applications so that you can use the API to send and receive data that your application can consume.

== Test an API with API Notebook

. Click API Notebook in the content page if one is available for the API.
. After you read the description for usage information, you can experiment with the example in the code block to try different parameters and values, and see the results in real time.
. Click Play to test the method in the code example and view the results.

== Search for Phrases

You can put a space between words to search for
case insensitive text that begins with each word you specify.
This is similar to putting the `*` wildcard regular expression after each word.
For example searching for `mq module` finds any asset that has text that
starts with `mq` or `module`.

Searching for a multiple word phrase shows assets that have every word in the phrase.

If you separate search words with any character other than a space, Exchange
converts the character to a space before searching.

=== Search Separators

Search lets you find Exchange assets that contain one or more terms.

If you input search words connected by non-alphanumeric symbols, Exchange replaces the symbols with spaces before searching for the term. The search string only succeeds if both words are present in the result. This is the same as the `word1 AND word2` relationship.

Example search terms:

[source,text,linenums]
----
sales:connect
Sales-Connect
connect:/sales
-connect -sales
----

The table that follows shows how each search term is interpreted depending on the values in the Asset Name,
Asset ID, and Tags for an asset. If the search term maps to the values correctly, a match occurs. If not,
the reason is provided.

[%header%autowidth.spread]
|===
|Asset Name |Asset ID |Tags |Matches?
|Salesforce API |salesforce-api |mule-Connector |Yes
|Salesforce Connector |salesforce-connector |REST |Yes
|Validations API |validations-api |salesforce-connecting |Yes
|Optimized API |optimized-api |resource:/connect, salesforce:enabled |Yes
|Cisco Sales API  |cisco-sales-api |Connecting, Productive |Yes
|Cisco Connector |cisco-connector |com.cisco.connector.sales
|Yes, because the tag is split into separate terms.
|Salesforce API |salesforce-api |muleconnector, MuleConnector |No. `connect` was not found.
|Salesforce Connec |salesforce-connec |REST |No. `connect` was not found.
|Validations API |validations-api |connector |No. `sales` was not found.
|Cisco Presales API |cisco-presales-api |Connector, api |No. `sales` was not found.
|===

=== Phrase Search Separators

Exchange search features phrase search, which allows you to query for a group of terms inside quotation marks. Phrase searches match an asset only if all the exact terms inside quotes appear in consecutive order.

If you input any of the following searches in Exchange, Exchange replaces non-alphanumeric symbols with spaces before searching for assets.

Example search terms:

[source,text,linenums]
----
Api: "Sales connect"
Api "Sales-connect"
Api "Sales:/connect"
Api-"Sales/connect"
"Sales connect":Api
----

The table that follows shows how each search term is interpreted depending on the values in the Asset Name,
Asset ID, and Tags for an asset. If the search term maps to the values correctly, a match occurs. If not,
the reason is provided.

[%header%autowidth.spread]
|===
|Asset Name |Asset ID |Tags |Matches?
|Salesforce API |salesforce-api |mule-Connector |No. `sales connect` was not found.
|Salesforce Connector |salesforce-connector |REST |No
|Sales Connect Asset |validations-api |mule-connector |Yes
|Sales Connect Images |validations-images |mule-connector |No. `api` was not found.
|Optimized API |optimized-api |resource:/connect, sales:enabled |No. `sales connect` was not found.
|Optimized API |optimized-api |resource:/sales, connect:enabled |No. `sales connect` was not found, because each term is in different tags.
|Optimized API |optimized-api |sales:/connect |Yes
|===

== Search Using Query Language

Using query language allows you to search assets by tags, categories, and custom fields.

=== Search by Tags

You can use the following structure to search by tags: `tag:"some value"` or `tag:value`

Double quotes are not necessary if the tag has no spaces.

Tag search is case insensitive.

Examples:

[%header%autowidth.spread]
|===
|Search |Tags |Matches?
|tag:"some value" |some value |Yes
|tag:"some value" |value |No
|tag:"value" |value |Yes
|tag:value |value |Yes
|tag:VALUE |value |Yes
|tag:VaLuE |value |Yes
|tag:value |val |No
|===

=== Search by Categories

You can use the following structure to search by categories: `category:"some key" = "some value"`

Double quotes are not necessary if the category has no spaces in the key or value.

The key can include the asterisk (`*`) regular expression to search for characters within a category name.

Key and value are case sensitive, except that if you search for the value in lowercase it matches.

Examples:

[%header%autowidth.spread]
|===
|Search |Category |Matches?
|category:my-key = my-value |my-key:my-value |Yes
|category:my-key = MY-VALUE |my-key:MY-VALUE |Yes
|category:my-key = my-value |my-key:MY-VALUE |Yes
|category:"my key" = "my value" |my key:my value |Yes
|category:"key" = "value" |my key:my value |No
|category:key = value |my-key:my-value |No
|category:this.* = value |this.is.my.key:value |Yes
|category:*my.key = value |this.is.my.key:value |Yes
|category:this.* = value |this.is.my.key:some-value |No
|category:this.* = some-* |this.is.my.key:some-value |No
|===

You can search for a combination of different categories, but you can't search for multiple values of the same category.

Multiple search terms use an implicit AND. OR is not supported.

The following search terms return all assets marked as both System APIs and Salesforce products:

`category:"API Type" = "System API" category:"Product" = "Salesforce"`

=== Search by Custom Fields

Similar to search by Categories, you can search for `field` instead `category` in the query language.

You can use the following structure to search by categories: `field:"some key" = "some value"`

Double quotes are not necessary if the custom field has no spaces in key or value.

The key can include the asterisk (`*`) regular expression to search for characters within a field name.

Key and value are case sensitive, except that if you search for the value in lowercase it matches.

Examples:

[%header%autowidth.spread]
|===
|Search |Field |Matches?
|field:my-key = my-value |my-key:my-value |Yes
|field:my-key = MY-VALUE |my-key:MY-VALUE |Yes
|field:my-key = my-value |my-key:MY-VALUE |Yes
|field:my-key = My-ValUe |my-key:MY-VALUE |No
|field:MY-KEY = my-value |my-key:my-value |No
|field:my-key = 10 |my-key:10 |Yes
|field:"my key" = "my value" |my key:my value |Yes
|field:"key" = "value" |my key:my value |No
|field:key = value |my-key:my-value |No
|field:this.* = value |this.is.my.key:value |Yes
|field:*my.key = value |this.is.my.key:value |Yes
|field:this.* = value |this.is.my.key:some-value |No
|field:this.* = some-* |this.is.my.key:some-value |No
|===

== Searching API Specifications

Exchange searches these API specification properties:

* API Title
* Base URI
* Endpoints
** Path
** Display name
** Description
Methods
** Method type (GET, POST, ...)
** Description
* Query Parameters
** Name
** Description
* URI Parameters
** Name
* Types
** Name

These property names are based on RAML specifications. Equivalent properties are indexed for OAS specifications. For example, RAML has base URI and OAS has host and path.

API specification search example:

[source,text,linenums]
----
#%RAML 1.0
---
title: Leagues API
version: v1
baseUri: https://leagues.com/api/

types:
 Team:
   properties:
     name: string
     city: string

/leagues/{leagueId}:
 displayName: League resource
 description: Contains all the information about a league
 uriParameters:
   leagueId:
     displayName: League ID
     description: The ID of the league to retrieve information from
 /teams:
   get:
     displayName: Teams directory
     description: Get list of all teams in the league
     queryParameters:
       offset:
         displayName: Offset
         description: Offset for the result set
     responses:
       200:
         body:
           application/json:
               type: Team[]
   post:
     displayName: Create team
     description: Creates a new team in the league
     responses:
       201:
         description: New team has been created
----

This API will be found by these searches:

[%header%autowidth.spread]
|===
|Search term |Matches
|league API |API title
|leagues.com |API baseUri
|`/leagues` |Endpoint path
|League resource |Endpoint display name
|Information about a league |Endpoint description
|POST |Endpoint method
|create team |Endpoint method description
|offset |Query parameter name, Query parameter description
|leagueid |URI parameter name
|team |Type name
|leagues leagueId teams |Endpoint path
|`/leagues/{leagueId}/teams` |Endpoint path
|===

The last two searches are the same, because special characters are removed before searching.
