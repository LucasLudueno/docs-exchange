Anypoint Exchange search looks for terms in:

* Each asset's name
* Tags
* Categories
* Custom attributes (also known as custom fields)
* The content of the asset portal pages
* xref:to-find-info.adoc#searching-api-specifications[Properties defined in RAML and OAS API specifications]

On an asset's details page, click a tag or category element to create a filtered search showing similar assets.

The original Exchange search experience is available in Anypoint Platform Private Cloud Edition, MuleSoft Government Cloud, the US cloud, and the EU cloud. The new Exchange search experience is available in the US cloud and the EU cloud.

== Tags, Categories, and Ranking in the New Exchange Search Experience

To filter search results by tags and categories in the new Exchange search experience, use the drop-down menus for tags and categories on the search page.

To select the ranking of search results in the new Exchange search experience, use the *Sort by* drop-down menu to choose *Relevance* (default), *Name*, *Last modified*, or *Rating*. *Relevance* sorts the matching results by where a match is found in the asset metadata, such as name, title, pages, and API specification metadata. API specification metadata includes endpoints and types.

== Searching in Organizations

In the original Exchange search experience, searches apply only to the Exchange organization you are viewing. If you search in a private Exchange organization, the search only lists that organization's assets and not MuleSoft's public assets.

In the new Exchange search experience, you can select which of the organizations visible to you should be included in each search. By default, no organization is selected in the drop-down menu, and Exchange searches MuleSoft's public assets and the assets of the master organization and its business groups.

== Save a Search

The original Exchange search experience and the new Exchange search experience save searches in the same way.

. Enter a search term and click *Save This Search*.
. Exchange prompts you to give the search a name, and to select if the search is for your organization or personal.
+
Administrators can save searches visible to anyone in their current business group. Personal searches are visible only to the person who creates them.
. View the left navigation bar to see the saved searches.
+
Exchange lists search terms specific to your business group. Below those terms are saved searches you created.

== Searching API Specifications

The original Exchange search experience and the new Exchange search experience process API specifications in the same way.

Exchange searches these API specification properties:

* API Title
* Base URI
* Endpoints
** Path
** Display name
** Description
* Methods
** Method type (GET, POST, PUT)
** Description
* Query Parameters
** Name
** Description
* URI Parameters
** Name
* Types
** Name
** Properties
* Traits
* Properties
* Security Schemas

These property names are based on RAML specifications. Equivalent properties are indexed for OAS specifications. For example, RAML has base URI and OAS has host and path.

API specification search example:

[source,text,linenums]
----
#%RAML 1.0
---
title: Leagues API
version: v1
baseUri: https://leagues.com/api/

types:
 Team:
   properties:

     displayName: League ID
     description: The ID of the league to retrieve information from
 /teams:

     queryParameters:
       offset:

     description: Creates a new team in the league
     responses:
       201:
         description: New team has been created

The last two searches are the same, because special characters are removed before searching.

== Search for Phrases in the Original Exchange Search Experience

In the original Exchange search experience, to search for case insensitive text
that begins with each word you specify, put a space between words.
This is similar to putting the `*` wildcard regular expression after each word.
For example, searching for `mq module` finds any asset that has text that
starts with `mq` or `module`.

Searching for a multiple word phrase shows assets that have every word in the phrase.

If you separate search words with any non-alphanumeric character other than a space, Anypoint Exchange
converts the character to a space before searching.

=== Search Separators

The original Exchange search experience uses search separators to find Exchange assets that contain one or more terms.

If you input search words connected by non-alphanumeric symbols, Exchange replaces the symbols with spaces before searching for the term. The search string only succeeds if both words are present in the result. This is the same as the `word1 AND word2` relationship.

Example search terms:

[source,text,linenums]
----
sales:connect
Sales-Connect
connect:/sales
-connect -sales
----

This table shows how each search term is interpreted depending on the values in the asset name,
asset ID, and tags for an asset. If the search term maps to the values correctly, a match occurs. If not,
the reason is provided.

[%header%autowidth.spread]
|===
|Asset Name |Asset ID |Tags |Matches?
|Salesforce API |salesforce-api |mule-Connector |Yes
|Salesforce Connector |salesforce-connector |REST |Yes
|Validations API |validations-api |salesforce-connecting |Yes
|Optimized API |optimized-api |resource:/connect, salesforce:enabled |Yes
|Cisco Sales API  |cisco-sales-api |Connecting, Productive |Yes
|Cisco Connector |cisco-connector |com.cisco.connector.sales
|Yes, because the tag is split into separate terms.
|Salesforce API |salesforce-api |muleconnector, MuleConnector |No. `connect` was not found.
|Salesforce Connec |salesforce-connec |REST |No. `connect` was not found.
|Validations API |validations-api |connector |No. `sales` was not found.
|Cisco Presales API |cisco-presales-api |Connector, api |No. `sales` was not found.
|===

=== Phrase Search Separators

The original Exchange search experience uses phrase search to find a group of terms inside quotation marks. Phrase searches match an asset only if all the exact terms inside quotes appear in consecutive order.

If you input any of these searches in Exchange, Exchange replaces non-alphanumeric symbols with spaces before searching for assets.

Example search terms:

[source,text,linenums]
----
Api: "Sales connect"
Api "Sales-connect"
Api "Sales:/connect"
Api-"Sales/connect"
"Sales connect":Api
----

This table shows how each search term is interpreted depending on the values in the asset name,
asset ID, and tags for an asset. If the search term maps to the values correctly, a match occurs. If not,
the reason is provided.

[%header%autowidth.spread]
|===
|Asset Name |Asset ID |Tags |Matches?
|Salesforce API |salesforce-api |mule-Connector |No. `sales connect` was not found.
|Salesforce Connector |salesforce-connector |REST |No
|Sales Connect Asset |validations-api |mule-connector |Yes
|Sales Connect Images |validations-images |mule-connector |No. `api` was not found.
|Optimized API |optimized-api |resource:/connect, sales:enabled |No. `sales connect` was not found.
|Optimized API |optimized-api |resource:/sales, connect:enabled |No. `sales connect` was not found, because each term is in different tags.
|Optimized API |optimized-api |sales:/connect |Yes
|===


== Search by Types, Tags, Categories, and Custom Fields in the Original Exchange Search Experience

In the original Exchange search experience, you can enter search text to search for assets, click *All Types* to set a filter for specific asset types, or combine search text with the filters listed in the type menu.

<<index.adoc#content-types,Content Types>> lists the different types of asset.

The original Exchange search experience uses query language to search assets by tags, categories, and custom fields.

=== Search by Tags

Search by tags with this structure: `tag:"some value"` or `tag:value`

If the value has no spaces, then double quotes are optional.

Tag search is case insensitive.

Examples:

[%header%autowidth.spread]
|===
|Search |Tags |Matches?
|tag:"some value" |some value |Yes
|tag:"some value" |value |No
|tag:"value" |value |Yes
|tag:value |value |Yes
|tag:VALUE |value |Yes
|tag:VaLuE |value |Yes
|tag:value |val |No
|===

=== Search by Categories

Search by categories with this structure: `category:"some key" = "some value"`

If the category has no spaces in the key or value, then double quotes are optional.

The key can include the asterisk (`*`) regular expression to search for characters within a category name.

The key is case sensitive.

A search value matches an asset value if either of these is true:

* The search value is entirely lower case.
* The search value and the asset value have matching case.

Examples:

[%header%autowidth.spread]
|===
|Search |Category |Matches?
|category:my-key = my-value |my-key:my-value |Yes
|category:my-key = MY-VALUE |my-key:MY-VALUE |Yes
|category:my-key = my-value |my-key:MY-VALUE |Yes
|category:"my key" = "my value" |my key:my value |Yes
|category:"key" = "value" |my key:my value |No
|category:key = value |my-key:my-value |No
|category:this.* = value |this.is.my.key:value |Yes
|category:*my.key = value |this.is.my.key:value |Yes
|category:this.* = value |this.is.my.key:some-value |No
|category:this.* = some-* |this.is.my.key:some-value |No
|===

You can search for a combination of different categories. You cannot search for multiple values of the same category.

Multiple search terms use an implicit `AND`. `OR` is not supported.

These search terms return all assets marked as both system APIs and Salesforce products:

`category:"API Type" = "System API" category:"Product" = "Salesforce"`

=== Search by Custom Fields

Search by fields with this structure: `field:"some key" = "some value"`

If the custom field has no spaces in the key or value, then double quotes are optional.

The key can include the asterisk (`*`) regular expression to search for characters within a field name.

The key is case sensitive.

A search value matches an asset value if either of these is true:

* The search value is entirely lower case.
* The search value and the asset value have matching case.

Examples:

[%header%autowidth.spread]
|===
|Search |Field |Matches?
|field:my-key = my-value |my-key:my-value |Yes
|field:my-key = MY-VALUE |my-key:MY-VALUE |Yes
|field:my-key = my-value |my-key:MY-VALUE |Yes
|field:my-key = My-ValUe |my-key:MY-VALUE |No
|field:MY-KEY = my-value |my-key:my-value |No
|field:my-key = 10 |my-key:10 |Yes
|field:"my key" = "my value" |my key:my value |Yes
|field:"key" = "value" |my key:my value |No
|field:key = value |my-key:my-value |No
|field:this.* = value |this.is.my.key:value |Yes
|field:*my.key = value |this.is.my.key:value |Yes
|field:this.* = value |this.is.my.key:some-value |No
|field:this.* = some-* |this.is.my.key:some-value |No
