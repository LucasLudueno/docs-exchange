Exchange introduces lifecycle states feature adding the possibility of moving an asset from different states, starting from "development," then "stable" and eventually "deprecated."

For every example during this documentation, these common fields should be replaced:

* ANYPOINT_TOKEN
* organizationId
* groupId
* assetId
* version
 
Note: Consider that the stable state is represented by the published name in the backend responses.
