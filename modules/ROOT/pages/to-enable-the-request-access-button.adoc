This topic requires the Exchange Administrator role.

Users specify what applications can have access to an API by clicking the
Request Access button image:ex2-request-access.png[Button - Request Access].

Exchange Administrators see the Request Access in the More Options menu image:ex2-more-options-icon.png[More Options icon].

However, just creating an API asset does not cause the Request Access button to display.
You have to configure the asset first:

. In API Manager, click Manage API > Manage API from Exchange to open the API.
. Use the URL of your API asset in Exchange as the Implementation URI in API Manager.
. After opening your API in API Manager, you can view the API Instance ID value as well as other useful information.
. To return to Exchange, click View API in Exchange.
. In Exchange, the Request Access button appears in the three dot menu.

Note: in API Manager, the API's Status is marked as Unregistered. To register the API, deploy the API to Runtime Manager; however, changing the API Status to Registered is not required for the API to be usable in Exchange.

== Request Access Display Criteria

A public portal displays the *Request Access* button only after these steps:

* Publish a REST, SOAP, or HTTP API in Exchange.
+
A REST API can be either an OAS or RAML API specification.
* Create an instance of the API in API Manager.
* Set the instance as public in *API Instances*.
* If the instance's URL is not present, set the instance's URL in *API Instances*.

If the instance is private, then the portal displays the *Request Access* button only to logged-in users.

If the instance is public, then the portal displays the *Request Access* button to all users. If a logged out user requests access, then Exchange prompts them to log in.
