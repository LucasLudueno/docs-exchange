Deprecating removes access to a version of an asset. The asset remains accessible for users.
A deprecated asset can be reverted and returned to use.

Asset administrators, Exchange administrators, and organization owners have the authorization to deprecate an asset. Set these permissions in xref:access-management::users.adoc#grant-user-permissions[the Access Management section of Anypoint Platform].

. Click the Settings icon at the upper right:

Alternatively, you can deprecate an API asset from its version menu:

+
. Click Deprecate to indicate a version that is no longer valid or supported
that consumers still use. Deprecate lets you keep an asset available.
. Confirm the action when prompted, or click Cancel to exit the prompt.

After a version has been deprecated, users see the `This version has been deprecated` message:

Administrators and organization owners also see the Revert button at the end of the message
and can click Revert to restore access to the version.
