Exchange provides usage metrics to gain insight about the consumption of assets. An Exchange Marketplace administrator who manages an organization's catalog of assets, wants to understand the reuse of assets in each business group's catalog. Understanding the reuse metrics can help promote and identify best practices in the organization. Application developers who manage assets in Exchange can evaluate and understand how assets are being reused to make informed decisions about updates, documentation, and deletion of versions of assets.

The Metrics dashboard displays the top assets for a specific time range or for an specific asset and hover-over for more details.
